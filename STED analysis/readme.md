Analysis code for STED images of ZO1 and PATJ at tight junctions

Make sure to add the folder "Matlab helper functions" to your MATLAB path.

The code produces a distance histogram of the potein PATJ to the most apical strand of the protein ZO1 (See figure 3 in the paper).

1. Use "Run_Distance_Analysis.m" to analyze STED images (.tif files) in the folder "Processed Images". Input images are multi-channel tif stacks with Ch1 = ZO1 signal, Ch2 = PATJ signal. Images were preprocessed using mild Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (8 iterations with gaussian PSF ch1 FWHM = 50nm and ch2 FWHM = 70 nm) to remove noise and have been rotated such that the apical side is at the top. See folder "Raw data" for unprocessed images. The code first segments and skeletonizes the ZO1 channel. Second the PATJ channel is segmented and the centers of PATJ clusters are identified. If necessary tweak segmentation input parameters to optain optimal segmentation. Finally, the nearest neighbor distance of each PATJ cluster to the most apical ZO1 strand is determined. The code saves the distance results (-Dist_Analysis.mat) for each image into the folder "Analysis Results".

2. Use "Pool_distance_measurements.m" to open all analyzed mat files in the folder "Analysis Results" and plot a histogram of the distances of PATJ to the apical interface. The code saves the pooled distance measurements and the Histogram-Figure into the same folder.
